# Spades
This is a project which attempts to use Artificial Intelligence to control three AI computer players. The computer AI players use Knowledge-Based Logical Agents as a template.

The rules of Spades can be found here:

In the source code you will be able to see the levels of perception that a AI player must take in order to make a decision. Follow the comments in the ComputerPlayer.cpp play function which is the main functionality of the AI player. Enjoy.
